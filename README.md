# `lit-html` transpiled to es5

The `lit-html` package is not transpiled to es5 by the team which maintains it. [Because reasons?](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html/issues/516).

This package is the same thing (with mirrored versions), but transpiled to es5 using babel.

```
$ npm install --save es5-lit-html
```

See the [`lit-html` docs](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/guide) for usage.
